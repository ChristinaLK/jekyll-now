### What Can I Do?

I have the following areas of expertise:

* Reading and assimilating new information quickly, identifying patterns, connecting ideas,
* Summarizing information, writing with clarity
* Designing curricula/lessons/workshops, preparing talks
* Teaching in both workshop-style and classroom settings
* Facilitating discussions and meetings
* Coordinating community events and workshops
* One-on-one tutoring

### Meaningful Experience

* [Center For High Throughput Computing][chtc], University of Wisconsin - Madison (Madison, WI)

* [The Carpentries][carpentries] (multiple locations)
  * I have been privileged to contribute to the Carpentries community (first as Software
    Carpentry, then Data Carpentry, then both together) over the course of several
    years; first as a workshop instructor, then as a lesson developer and maintainer,
    then as a community organizer, then as a trainer of other instructors, and finally
    as a member of the Software Carpentry leadership team.  In these different roles,
    I have gained a tremendous amount of experience, including:
      * communicating difficult concepts to non-experts
      * detailed event planning and coordination
      * collaborating with a team
      * community engagement, organization and governance
      * lesson development
      * training and experience in best pedagogical practices
      * developing skills in computing tools

* [Academy of Hope][aoh] (Washington, DC)
  * During my year at Academy of Hope, I taught basic math and English to
  aspiring GED and EDP adults.  I learned as much or more than my learners,
  not only about preparing and delivering lessons, but about connecting with
  others (regardless of background) and living in solidarity.  AoH's founders
  put it best in the Hope's original mission statement:
  > "Academy of Hope will be a school in which the main subject for everyone, teachers
and students alike, is not reading, writing or math but hope. Hope comes only when we
care and are cared for. In this academy, all of us are teachers because all of us can care for
one another. And in this academy, all of us are students since all of us need to be cared for."

* [St. Olaf College][olaf] (Northfield, MN)
  * At St. Olaf, I had the classic liberal arts smorgasboard: played music (St. Olaf Band,
    St. Olaf Orchestra), studied abroad (Budapest, Hungary), majored in math
    but took a variety of classes ([the Great Conversation][gc], French, English, philosophy, computer
    science), did research, and graduated summa cum laude.

to most purposes and given 1-2 months of using the tool, would be a near-expert
