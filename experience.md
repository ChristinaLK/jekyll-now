### What Can I Do?

I have the following areas of expertise:

* Reading and assimilating new information quickly, writing with clarity
* Identifying patterns, connecting ideas, summarizing information
* Designing curricula/lessons, preparing talks
* Teaching and facilitating in both workshop-style and classroom settings
* Leading discussions and meetings
* Coordinating community events and workshops
* One-on-one tutoring

### Meaningful Experience

* UW Madison

* Carpentries
As a Carpentries instructor, I have gained valuable cross-discipline experience: communicating difficult concepts to non-experts, developing skills in computing tools, collaborating with a team, and demonstrating my commitment to better computing skills by volunteering my time. My involvement with the Carpentries also introduced me to a unique professional community of people who care about research and computing, which is typically not found in a single university/lab/office. This community has introduced me to new ideas, tools, and job postings from off the beaten path.  

* AoH

* St. Olaf College, where I graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of
Arts in mathematics, and also found time to study abroad in Budapest, Hungary, play and tour with the
St. Olaf Band and St. Olaf Orchestra, and participate in a two-year great books program.  
After graduation, I spent a year
working at an adult education non-profit in Washington, DC, teaching adult basic education
courses in math and writing.
