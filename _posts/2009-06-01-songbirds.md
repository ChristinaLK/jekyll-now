St. Olaf was the kind of place my friends and I would
get together on weekend nights and sing folk songs together in our dorm.   

The night before graduation, we sat around one of our dorm rooms amidst
the wreckage of preparing to leave campus in two days
and recorded an EP of some of our favorite songs.  I'm not sure where
the recording is, but if it had ever gone to press, this could have been
