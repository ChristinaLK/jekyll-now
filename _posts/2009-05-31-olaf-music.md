title: Percussion Galore
---

When I was in college, I played percussion (bit of everything, although I was
  a pretty rubbish snare and timpani player) with the St. Olaf
  Orchestra and St. Olaf Band, two very fine musical organizations.  These are some of my
  favorite concerts.  

(Video quality is not great because this streaming video was still a pretty new thing.)

* Not available on video: St. Olaf Orchestra fall tour and St. Olaf Band fall concert, 2006.
* [St. Olaf Orchestra, featuring the new organ in Boe Chapel][organ]
  * This is mostly for the final piece -- Saint-Saens Organ Symphony (with a 4th
  movement lifted for use in the movie *Babe*) with some of the finest cymbal
  crashes you'll ever hear, played by yours truly.
* [St. Olaf Orchestra, accompanying Senior Soloists][senior]
  * I've re-listened to this concert at least 20-30 times.  Highlights
  include Rachmaninoff piano concerto,  , and Bolero.
* [St. Olaf Orchestra, celebration weekend][orch-pines]
  * Pines of Rome.  ::hearteyes::  Has to be experienced live.
* [St. Olaf Band, celebration weekend][band-celebrate]
  * Lots of fun pieces on this program, with my personal favorite being "Play!"
* [St. Olaf Band, family  weekend concert][science]
  * One of my favorite pieces of concert programming.  Built around a "science" theme
    with a great diversity of pieces.  
* [St. Olaf Band chapel performance][faith]
  * I did the intro.  
* [St. Olaf Band, spring concert][maslanka]
  * Featuring David Maslanka's Symphony no. 8.  If you don't think bands can
  provide the same depth/gravitas of an orchestra, give it a listen.
* [St. Olaf Orchestra, celebration weekend][orch-celebrate]
  * Another program I have listened to over and over.  Tons of classics.
