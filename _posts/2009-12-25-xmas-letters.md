title: Christmas Letters
---

From at least high school onward, I was the primary author of the
family Christmas letter/update.  When I graduated from college, I decided that
from now on I was writing my *own* letter.  This is the inaugural effort,
from Christmas 2009.

If you know me personally and are interested in
additional years of the Christmas letter archive,
send me an email.
